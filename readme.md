# spacelib

This package contains a few tools for off-policy reinforcement learning, particularly with recurrent agents and particularly for learning directly from pixel observations.

### usage

See the batch sequence sampling [notebook](https://github.com/kandouss/spacelib/blob/master/examples/Batch%20sequence%20sampling.ipynb) for an example of the same.
